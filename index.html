                     is not simply the slaughtering of an animal and the distribution

                      the sacrifice of Ibrahim (as). The word ‘Qurbani’ is derived from the Arabic,

                    One of the five pillars of Islam central to Muslim belief, Hajj is the pilgrimage to Mecca that every Muslim must make at least once in their lifetime if they are able; it is the most spiritual event that a Muslim experiences, observing rituals in the most sacred places in the Islamic world. Mecca is the birthplace of the Prophet Muhammad. The sanctuary there with the Ka‘ba is the holiest site in Islam. As such, it is a deeply spiritual destination for Muslims all over the world; it is the heart of Islam

                            The concept and definition of the word is derived from the Qur'an, the sacred scripture of Muslims, and is the analog of korban in Judaism. While the word and concept are similar as in other Abrahamic religions, there is notably an opposition of the burnt offering,[3] with the spoils of the sacrifice being distributed as food to the impoverished and family of the one making the offering for consumption.

                            There is no doubt that forgiveness is the reward God has promised for those who offer the pilgrimage and the Umrah to emphasize their submission to Him. This is not surprising because God forgives anyone who turns to Him in genuine repentance, even when the sins he has committed are grave indeed.
