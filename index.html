                <p class="box-blog-paragraph">Qurbani, or Udhiya as it is known in Arabic,<br>
                     is not simply the slaughtering of an animal and the distribution 
                     of its meat. Nor is it merely a commemorative ritual centred around 
                      the sacrifice of Ibrahim (as). The word ‘Qurbani’ is derived from the Arabic,
                       ‘qurban’, which has its root in the Arabic word ‘qurb’ – meaning ‘nearness’.<br>
                        The purpose of offering Qurbani is to draw near to Allah.
